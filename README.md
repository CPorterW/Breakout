# Overview

I made a simple breakout game using canvas and ctx. I want to expand this project by adding upgrades, a new look and breaking animations. I used a tutorial cited below to get started, but you will see that I did not use the same code as is in the tutorial. I made my game expandable, adaptable, and dynamic. For instance, the ball can bounce off the sides and top of the bricks, which feature took 8 hours to perfect. The paddle responds to the mouse instead of the keyboard, and the canvas and shapes grow and shrink based on viewport width. The variables are all designed to be independently, easily upgraded or adjusted as I add new features to the game.

I wanted to learn how to make graphics in Javascript, so that I could make the web games that I grew up on. I want to evolve this project into something I'm proud to share with my friends, that they might play it all the way through and enjoy every minute of it. I want to take the things I've learned from this project and take a shot at other videogame cliches like tower defense and platformers.

I've provided a walkthrough below. This is my first time making such a video so bear with me :)
